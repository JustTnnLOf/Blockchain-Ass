Simple Python Blockchain Implementation
This is a simplified Python implementation of a blockchain, which includes features such as block structure, initialization, adding blocks, transaction handling, and basic proof-of-work mining. It also provides a basic command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Please note that this implementation is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments without significant enhancements and security measures.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-blockchain.git
Change into the project directory:

Usage
The blockchain CLI provides several options for interacting with the blockchain:

Adding Transactions
To add a transaction to the pending transactions list:

Choose option 1 from the menu.
Enter the sender's address.
Enter the recipient's address.
Enter the transaction amount.
Mining Blocks
To mine a new block and add it to the blockchain:

Choose option 2 from the menu.
Enter the miner's reward address (where the mining reward will be sent).
Displaying the Blockchain
To display the entire blockchain:

Choose option 3 from the menu.
Validating the Blockchain
To check the validity of the blockchain:

Choose option 4 from the menu.
The program will display whether the blockchain is valid or not.
